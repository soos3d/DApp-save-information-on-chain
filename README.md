# simple-dApp-save-a-string-on-chain
This simple dApp demonstrates a blockchain use case different than DeFi. This website allows you to connect your MetaMask wallet to it and then interact with a smart contract to save a string on a chain, testnet Fantom in this case. The saved string is associated with the address, and only that same address can retrieve it.
