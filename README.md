# dApp to save and retrieve a string on chain
This simple dApp demonstrates a blockchain use case different than DeFi.

This website allows you to connect your MetaMask wallet to it and then interact with a smart contract to save a string on a chain, testnet Fantom in this case. The saved string is associated with the address, and only that same address can retrieve it.

The most known use cases for blockchain technology are linked to DeFi, but these networks are an amazing resource to store information in general, as once the data is stored, it is recorded on chain permanently.
