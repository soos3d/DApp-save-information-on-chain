            <p>Blockchain technology is more than just DeFi applications, the possibilities are endless, and this website was created to demonstrate that. Blockchains are a great system to store information.</p>
            <p>The smart contract linked to this website allows an address to store a sentence, can be a word, a code, or anything else you would like to save. And only that same address can retrieve and read that information.</p>
            <p class="center">Smart contract address <a href="https://testnet.ftmscan.com/address/0x0287f57a1a17a725428689dfd9e65eca01d82510#code" target="_blank">0x0287f57A1a17a725428689dfD9E65ECA01d82510</a>, on the Fantom Testnet</p>

            <h3 class="center">Warning!</h3>
            <p><b>Keep in mind that this dApp is created for educational purposes, it is not designed with any security measure, and even though the blockchain nature should already be relatively secure, you should avoid storing actual sensitive information, the idea is just to show a use case.</b></p>
            <p class="center">Any time you save a new string from the same address, the previous one is overwritten!</p>
            <p class="center">The areas to interact with are divided by very distinct colors.</p>
